    <p>Konkret is offering you static websites with a minimalistic design. Perfect for small businesses, shop ownes, freelancers and bloggers. Because we are cheaper then an agency and better then Jimdo, Wix, Wordpress and others.</p>
    <p>Static webdesign does not mean that there is nothing moving on your website. The term static only refers to the way your website is generated and stored. <a href='https://de.wordpress.com/'>Wordpress</a> and <a href='https://de.jimdo.com/'>Jimdo</a> for instance are utilising dynamic web technology. Meaning that you load up your content somewhere and everytime someone visits you, your website is generated from your content and your style preferences. For our static websites we use the, open-source, static web page generator <a href='https://gohugo.io/'>HUGO</a>.</p>
    <p>Static webdesign works different. Every page and subpage is a single file stored on a server. And everytime someone visits your website this document is delivered to him. Static website are often faster, more secure and more flexible when it comes to the design. We have full control over the website and are therefore able to fulfill all your needs and whishes.</p>
    <p>And we can do a lot for you and your projects. Of cause writing the website in HTML and styling it with CSS. Experience in the fields of typography, graphic design and UI design make our websites not only good-looking but als well-functioning. We are also capable of delivering animations and functions with JavaScript and CSS (such as a dark mode, social media buttons or custom pop-ups)</p>
    <p>But there is more! We can help you setting up your hosting, domain and DNS. And we can answer all your questions regarding a secure hosting and backend (or even host your site ourselves). With the topics of secure connections and SSL encription we can help you as well. We do also have experience working with search engine optimization (which does not mean we are a agency specialized on SEO), <a href='https://www.google.de/intl/de/analytics/'>Google Analytics</a> and the <a href='https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/4559176?hl=de'>Search Console</a>.</p>
    <p>We also have the ability to create sound, video and image in studio quality and experience working with a lot of software for editing those (Photoshop, InDesign, DaVinci und Studio). We have experienced photographers with us and we co-work with an experienced videographer. It doesn`t matter what your plans are with your webiste, we are going to realise them.</p>
    <p>Sounds good to you? Then get to know <a href='https://konkretdesign.github.io/itsus'>us</a> and write an <a href='mailto:konkretdesign@outlook.de?subject=hello'>e-mail</a>.</p>
